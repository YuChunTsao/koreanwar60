<p>Staff Sgt Reckless was a small Mongolian mare that served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War. During the 5-day Battle of Outpost Vegas in March of 1953 on a single day Reckless made 51 trips by herself, carrying ammunition to the firing sites. Much of that travel was up the side of a mountain. She also carried wounded soldiers back down for treatment. She was wounded twice in that battle. Her many military decorations include two Purple Hearts. She retired in 1960 at Camp Pendleton and died in 1968. A memorial statue of Reckless will be dedicated at the Marine Corps Museum in Quantico, VA on July 26, 2013. Additional information will be provided.
